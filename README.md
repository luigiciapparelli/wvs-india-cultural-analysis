# Cultural Values in India â€“ WVS Automation (R)

This repository contains R scripts used in the thesis **"Power Distance, Religiosity, and Economic Development in a Collectivist Society:
A Cultural Analysis of India"** (2025, University of Bologna) to:

- Harmonize World Values Survey (WVS) data across waves
- Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on political trust and religious belief items
- Construct Power Distance and Disbelief indices
- Visualize time-series and correlation trends
- Enable automated replication with future WVS releases

## Structure

- `preprocess_wvs.R`: Cleans and harmonizes WVS data across waves
- `pdi_index_pca.R`: Constructs a Power Distance Index using PCA
- `disbelief_index_pca.R`: Builds a Disbelief Index using PCA
- `timeseries_plots.R`: Produces line plots over time
- `correlation_plots.R`: Scatterplots with GDP and cultural indices
